[31m[1mCMake Error[0m at /home/users/astronomity/gps_ws/src/gps_navigation/build/catkin_tools_prebuild/CMakeLists.txt:12 (message):
  The catkin CMake module was not found, but it is required to build a linked
  workspace.  To resolve this, please do one of the following, and try
  building again.



   1. Source the setup.sh file from an existing catkin workspace:
      source SETUP_FILE



   2. Extend another catkin workspace's result (install or devel) space:
      catkin config --extend RESULT_SPACE



   3. Set `catkin_DIR` to the directory containing `catkin-config.cmake`:
      catkin config --cmake-args -Dcatkin_DIR=CATKIN_CMAKE_CONFIG_PATH



   4. Add the catkin source package to your workspace's source space:
      cd SOURCE_SPACE && git clone https://github.com/ros/catkin.git
